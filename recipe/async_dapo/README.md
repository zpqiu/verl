# Async DAPO Recipe

## Overview

Inspired by MiMo, this Async DAPO recipe combines veRL's AgentLoop async rollout functionality with the DAPO algorithm to enhance end-to-end training efficiency. This recipe provides efficient distributed processing with intelligent resource management, early stopping mechanisms, and dynamic task scheduling for large language model training.

## Key Features

- **🚀 Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking concurrent request handling for maximum throughput
- **⚡ Early Stopping Mechanism**: Intelligent early termination when target objectives are met
- **🔄 Dynamic Load Balancing**: Global load balancer with real-time server allocation
- **🎯 Seamless Reward Computation & Filtering**: Immediate reward calculation and DAPO-like prompt filtering upon response completion, eliminating the need to wait for entire batch rollout

## Usage

### 0. Install veRL

```bash
git clone https://github.com/volcengine/verl
cd verl
# !IMPORTANT: checkout the commit, otherwise there may be incompatibility issues
git checkout ac826e0558017a9c675818f36cbb3473c14a2a50
pip install -e .
```

### 1. Prepare Data

```bash
export DATA_HOME=${DATA_HOME:-"${HOME}/data"}
bash prepare_dapo_data.sh
```

### 2. Train

We use Qwen3-8B-Base and the DAPO dataset as the model and data. The main training hyperparameters are from DAPO.

```bash
export VLLM_USE_V1=1 
export HOME_DIR=${HOME}
bash test_qwen3_8b.sh
```

## Core Mechanisms

### 1. Early Stopping Coordination

The Early Stopping Coordinator provides intelligent termination control to optimize training efficiency and prevent unnecessary computation.

**Key Components:**
- **Global State Tracking**: Monitors completed prompts across all workers
- **Completion Validation**: Tracks both valid and invalid prompt completions
- **Signal Propagation**: Broadcasts early stopping signals to all active workers

**Implementation Flow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as Worker
    participant ESC as Early Stopping Coordinator
    participant ALM as Agent Loop Manager
    
    ALM->>ESC: Initialize(expected_prompt_num)
    loop For each completed prompt
        W->>ESC: report_completion(sample_index, is_valid)
        ESC->>ESC: Check if target reached
        alt Target Reached
            ESC->>W: should_stop_generation() → True
            W->>W: Cancel pending tasks
        else Continue
            ESC->>W: should_stop_generation() → False
        end
    end
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents overcomputation when sufficient data is collected
- Maintains training quality by tracking completion validity
- Reduces resource waste through intelligent task cancellation

### 2. Global Load Balancing

The Global Load Balancer implements sophisticated server allocation strategies to maximize resource utilization and minimize request latency.

**Load Balancing Strategies:**

#### Semaphore-Based Capacity Control
```python
# Capacity management with threading.Semaphore
total_capacity = max_loads_per_server * num_servers
semaphore = threading.Semaphore(total_capacity)

# Server allocation with load tracking
def get_server_index():
    semaphore.acquire()  # Wait for available capacity
    min_load_server = min(servers, key=lambda s: s.current_load)
    min_load_server.current_load += 1
    return min_load_server.index
```

#### Least Connection Algorithm
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Load Balancer"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        H[Min-Heap]
    end
    
    subgraph "Servers"
        S1["Server 1<br/>Load: 5"]
        S2["Server 2<br/>Load: 3"]
        S3["Server 3<br/>Load: 7"]
    end
    
    LB --> H
    H --> S2
    
    style S2 fill:#90EE90
    style S1 fill:#FFE4E1
    style S3 fill:#FFE4E1
```

**Features:**
- **Capacity Control**: Prevents server overload through semaphore-based limits
- **Load Distribution**: Uses min-heap for efficient least-loaded server selection
- **Session Affinity**: LRU cache maintains request-to-server mapping for consistency

### 3. Dynamic Task Management

Dynamic task creation optimizes memory usage and provides responsive processing through adaptive concurrency control.

**Task Lifecycle Management:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PendingQueue: Tasks Queued
    PendingQueue --> Running: Create Task (up to max_concurrent)
    Running --> Completed: Task Finished
    Running --> Cancelled: Early Stop Signal
    Completed --> PendingQueue: Create New Task
    Cancelled --> [*]
    Completed --> [*]: No More Pending
    
    note right of Running: Max concurrent tasks:\nconfigurable limit
```

**Implementation Details:**

```python
# Dynamic task creation with concurrent limit
max_concurrent_tasks = config.max_concurrent_prompts
pending_prompts = list(prompt_groups.items())
pending_tasks = {}

# Create initial batch
for _ in range(min(max_concurrent_tasks, len(pending_prompts))):
    sample_index, group_data = pending_prompts.pop(0)
    task = asyncio.create_task(process_prompt_group(sample_index, group_data))
    pending_tasks[task] = sample_index

# Main processing loop
while pending_tasks:
    # Wait for any task completion
    done, still_pending = await asyncio.wait(
        pending_tasks.keys(), 
        return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED
    )
    
    # Process completed tasks and create new ones
    for task in done:
        process_completed_task(task)
        if pending_prompts and not early_stop_triggered:
            create_new_task()
```

**Advantages:**
- **Memory Efficiency**: Prevents memory overflow from excessive concurrent tasks
- **Responsive Processing**: Immediate task creation upon completion
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Automatically adjusts to available resources

## Experiments

The `test_qwen3_8b.sh` script is just a simple example to show how to use this async DAPO recipe.

The following experiments are conducted on multiple nodes and with a larger max_response_length (16k).

![The training curve of Qwen3-8B-Base on DAPO dataset](assets/exp-qwen3-8b.png)

- Green Line: using the above async DAPO recipe
- Red Lines: the baseline, using the original AgentLoop async rollout.

From the above figure, we can see that the async DAPO recipe can achieve a similar performance to the baseline, but with a much lower rollout time.

Overall throughput has improved by about 10%, and the time spent in the rollout phase has decreased by 20%.
